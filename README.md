# AI-Powered Resume Analyzer üîç

**Live demo:** <https://resume-analyzer0.netlify.app/>  

Need to know‚Äîquickly‚Äîwhether a r√©sum√© actually matches a job post?  
Upload a PDF, paste (or link) the job description, and get a clear ‚Äúfit score,‚Äù keyword overlap, and plain-English feedback in seconds.

> ‚ÄúIt feels like having a mini recruiter on my laptop.‚Äù ‚Äî me, after writing too many cover letters

## What it does

* **Reads your r√©sum√©** (first 10 pages, no freezes) and counts words, skills, top terms.
* **Pulls the job ad** (paste text *or* drop a URL) and cleans it up automatically.
* **Compares them** with TF-IDF cosine similarity *and* a straight keyword hit-list.
* Flags red flags‚Äîmissing keywords, generic objectives, unexplained gaps (basic regex).
* Gives you a one-line verdict: **Excellent / Good / Fair**.
